# Data Science Workstation Setup
Welcome! If you are totally new to coding, what you are reading right now is called a README, and this text is being generated from the README.md file. Written using an easy-to-learn syntax called "markdown", READMEs help other developers to learn how to best navigate your code repository. In this particular case, we are using the README to introduce this data science workstation setup guide as well as how to properly navigate it!

If you already have some experience doing software development, it may be that you already have some of these tools (or close equivalents) already installed. In that case, feel free to jump around to install what you need. If you are totally new to software development, I'd recommend following sticking with the path as it is laid out.

So as not to clutter this particular space, I've separated the tutorials for the respective tools into their own folders (or directories) as part of this Git repository. Please click on the respective directory to learn more about that topic!

## Hardware Recommendation
Before moving forward, you might be curious if you need any specific hardware. When you're first getting up and going, I think any modern PC will work. I will recommend that it's any machine that has either the Windows or macOS operating systems. Tablets (e.g. iPads) will unfortunately not work, and I can't say about Chromebooks. But don't worry about things like RAM or processor speed!

## Suggested Installation Order
- Anaconda

**8/30 Update at 3:30pm CST**: I'm taking a break for a little while! I'll come back to update the rest later this evening. But if I forget or something, as long as you have Anaconda installed, you'll be good for tomorrow night's stream!

- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Git
- Docker
- Code Editor
- pip
