# Anaconda

## What is Anaconda?
Anaconda is an all-in-one suite of tools for installing almost everything a data scientist needs to their work. Anaconda has a free to use variant for individuals that we will be installing as part of this setup guide. As part of the Anaconda suite, Anaconda will install:

- **CLI Tools**: We'll touch more on the CLI in that respective section. In any case, as part of the overall installation, you will have the Anaconda CLI tools also installed.
- **Jupyter**: Jupyter is a nice interface almost all data scientists use for exploratory work. It is super convenient as it allows being able to make comments and visualizations right in line with real, running code.
- **Python**: Python is the primary programming language the data science field uses. (R would be the next one after Python.)

This isn't everything Anaconda installs, but it contains the important ones to say the least!
